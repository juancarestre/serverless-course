tradeoff
pros
cons
1. pro: speed, you and your team increase developing speed because you dont worries about server management, scalling and mantainability, you grant this responsability to the 
cons: its easier to commit failures configuring the services and failures in serverless are expensive or create a bad experience for developers or your customers

2. pro: the developers team gets empowered, they can create and manage services without help of operations team, improving development experience
cons: lack of knowledge about cloud services can be frustrating for developers and can block them in ther development tasks

3. pro: high speed creating dev/staging enviroment, services are created and destroyed easily
con: its hard to create local dev enviroment, some serverless services are designed to live within cloudproviders computers, some for that reason it becomes hard to simulate this services in your local computer for local dev envs, its possible but hard

4. pro: high scaling and availability without almost any effort, serverless services are created to scalate and to server a high traffic demand
con: sometimes can be expensive if the service is bad configurated, sometimes serverless dont worth in comparition of a estandar server application

5. pro: almost free for small o medium size applications, all cloud providers offers generous free tiers that allows to create free to mantain apps using serverless applicaciones
con: not too good for high realtime high demanded apps, it can be expensive but the technologie advance fast and serverless services are growing to make this use case viable
